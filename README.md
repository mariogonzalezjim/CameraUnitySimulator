# CameraUnitySimulator
 A tool to simulate a multi-camera system using 3D virtual data


## About The Project

CameraUnitySimulator is a software tool to simulate multi-camera systems using
3D virtual data. This tool offers an alternative to traditional Computer Vision research by addressing the technical and flexibility limitations of common testing environments that are based on pre-recorded videos or live video streams from network
cameras. The objective of this project is to provide a flexible testing environment for
Computer Vision algorithms where it can be simulated virtual scenarios which cannot
be easily replicated with real world. This tool is based on the Unity game engine that
allows to design and to load realistic 3D environments and extends its funcionality
with a multi-camera system able to simulate the management of several distributed
virtual cameras in real time, as well as setting their properties and transmitting the
captured frames to third party applications (i.e. algorithms). 


## Architecture

CameraUnitySimulator uses a Client-Server
architecture that allows the remote configuration and use of the system as well
as in localhost mode.
